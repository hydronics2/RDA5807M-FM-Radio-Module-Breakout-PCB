# RDA5807M-FM-Radio-Module-Breakout-PCB

This is a simple breakout board for a RDA5807 Radio Module available for less than $1. This PCB was designed in Eagle. The PCB can be purchased through [oshpark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/gvh1B0PT). For prototyping connectors I used screw terminals at 5.08mm pitch [like these](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20190221213812&SearchText=screw+terminal+block+5.08mm).

The RDA 5807M is single chip broadcast FM stereo Radio tuner with both frequency selection and RDS/RBDS decoder over i2c. The RDA5807M series support FM bands 50MHz to 115MHz.

I'll be using the arduion IDE to program a microcontroller to use the RDA5807M.
